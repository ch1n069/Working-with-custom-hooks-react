# WORKING WITH HOOKS IN REACT

In this project we are going to be doing a deep dive into working with hooks in react.

# Getting started

1. Clone the repo

```bash

```

# UseOnline

- We are going to start with this hook which will help us detect when the user is online.
- We can then later in any section of the app when the user is online or offline show various components depending, on their online status.
